# Lab 16: Chirp Express: The SeQueL - Continuation (CRUD)
## Due: Friday, June 23rd, 09:00
##### Covalence
###### Full Stack: Summer 2017

## Info
* In the first iteration of this lab, you created a database with a table for chirps
* In this lab, you will be writing MySQL stored procedures and API endpoints in Express to make our app fully CRUD-worthy
* You can use MySQL Workbench to complete this lab (in fact I recommend it)

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a .gitignore file in the root of this repository to ignore node_modules
* Copy your package.json, client, and server folders over to this project from lab 14
* You can delete data.json from the server folder
    * Will no longer be storing/reading to data.json
    * Instead, we are going to use the database
    * Still statically serving the `client` directory (index.html, script.js, etc.)
* You will need to run `npm install` again
* `nodemon` should still start your server when you get it up and running

## Objectives
* Add stored procedures to your database for getting all chirps, getting a single chirp, inserting a chirp, updating a chirp, and deleting a chirp. See detailed request outlines below.
* Add the appropriate routes to your express server to receive the various RESTful requests to kick off the above actions
* In those route handlers, communicate with the database server using the mysql node module
* In particular, your server should perform in the following manner
    * When all chirps are requested:
        * Should call the procedure to get all chirps, and should respond with them
    * When one chirp is requested:
        * Should call the procedure to get a single chirp and respond with it
    * When a chirp should be created:
        * Should call the procedure to insert a chirp and respond with the auto-gen id of the created chirp
        * In the stored procedure, the timestamp should be set to NOW()
        * This means that you will no longer set the timestamp on the front-end
        * Status code should be 201
    * When a chirp should be updated
        * Should call the procedure to update an existing chirp
        * Only the message can be updated
        * Should just respond with code/status 204
    * When a chirp should be deleted
        * Should call the procedure to delete an existing chirp
        * Should just respond with code/status 204

## Front-End Modifications
* Add a delete button/icon to each chirp in the list on the page. Clicking the button/icon should delete the chirp from the database and reload the list of chirps
* At this time, we will not be showing a visual means of viewing a single chirp or updating a chirp
    * Will be added when we get to Angular!

## Tips / Hints
* We will no longer be using data.json anymore!
* You will find Express route parameters useful (see Express slides)
* You will find the body-parser useful (see Express slides)

## Go the Extra Mile
* Finished early? Want to expand your skills?
* Instead of writing functions that return a promise for calling a stored procedure for every procedure, try consolidating and having a single function that takes a procedure name and an array of arguments as the parameters and returns a promise.
* Hint: You can write code that will add the ?,?,?,?.... when it is necessary
